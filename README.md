In this project we implemented two functions for intensity operations on a given .tif image from Spine; Contrast Stretching and Powelaw transform.
In the next step, we demonstrated how differently they can appear; 
for example, power law transform with gamma<1 (=0.5 in this project) will result in brightened images
Contrast stretching transform will result in better contrast.
