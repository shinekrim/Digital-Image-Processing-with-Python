In this project we implemented two functions for intensity operations on a given .tif image from Spine; Contrast Stretching and Powelaw transform.
In the next step, we demonstrated how differently they can apear; 
for example powerlaw transform with gamma<1 (=0.5 in this project) will result in more brighten images
Contrast stretching transform will result in better contrast.
